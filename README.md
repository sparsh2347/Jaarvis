   `assignment_gen.py` sends the question text to GPT and generates a DOCX draft.

3. **User Edits**  
   DOCX is opened for manual editing by the user in MS Word or LibreOffice.

4. **Auto-Save and Convert**  
   After editing, the DOCX is automatically saved and converted to PDF.

5. **Submit Assignment**  
   `classroom.py` uploads the final PDF directly to the correct assignment submission portal.
