   `assignment_gen.py` sends the question text to GPT and generates a DOCX draft.

3. **User Edits**  
   DOCX is opened for manual editing by the user in MS Word or LibreOffice.

4. **Auto-Save and Convert**  
   After editing, the DOCX is automatically saved and converted to PDF.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sparsh2347/jaarvis.git
cd jaarvis
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required Libraries**:
- `selenium`
- `pyautogui`
- `python-docx`
- `docx2pdf`
- `Pypdf2`
- `fpdf`
- `docx2pdf`

### 3. **ChromeDriver Setup**
- Ensure that Google Chrome is installed on your system.
- Download the appropriate version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) that is compatible with your installed version of Google Chrome.
  (Recommended version: 136.7103.0.93)
- Place the `chromedriver` executable either in your system's PATH or within your project directory.
- Update the `chrome_driver` path in each of the Selenium scripts accordingly:
  ```python
  service = Service("C:/Users/spars/OneDrive/Desktop/Google Downloads/chromedriver-win64/chromedriver-win64/chromedriver.exe")

### 4. **Configure Google Classroom Profile**

To automate Google Classroom interactions using Selenium, use an existing Chrome user profile where you're already logged in to Google. This will ensure that the script can access your Google Classroom and ChatGPT without requiring additional authentication steps.

#### Steps:
1. **Use an existing Chrome user profile** with Google login already authenticated. This allows the automation script to interact with Google Classroom without requiring you to log in every time.

2. **Update the profile path** in the Selenium script:
   In the script, find the line where the `options.add_argument` method is used, and provide the path to your Chrome user profile. It should look something like this:
   ```python
   options.add_argument("user-data-dir=path/to/your/chrome/profile")
   options.add_argument("profile-directory=profile_name") 
   ```
3. **Find the Chrome Profile Path**

   To locate the path of your Chrome user profile, follow these steps:
   1. Open Chrome and type the following URL in the address bar:
      ```html
      chrome://version/
      ```
   2.On the resulting page, look for the "Profile Path" entry. This will show the location of       your Chrome profile on your system.

   Example profile path:
      ```profile_path
      C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data
      ```


## 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
python auto_submit.py
```

This will:
